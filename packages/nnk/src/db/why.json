    "fullInto": "Many people are forced to escape from poverty, armed conflicts, or prosecutions. Most of them flee to find in Europe the peace and civil rights that they are missing at home. However, there are no safe pathways to migrate and people are exposed to violent ilegal pushbacks instead of sustainable solutions.",
    "blackBook": "The ‘Black Book of Pushbacks’ is a collection of hundreds of testimonies of migrants and asylum seekers who have experienced human rights violations at external borders. It includes 892 group testimonies detailing the experiences of 12,654 people, describing the violence many endured in Italy, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary along the so-called ‘Balkan route’ including maps, data, photos and other key information. By bringing to light the suffering, NNK and our partners in the BVMN claim EU institutions and member state governments to be held accountable for the inhumane and degrading treatment of the people.",

Like that I couldn’t protect my face. When the policeman got tired from beating, the second one grabbed the back of my shirt. I told them: “Stop! You’re hurting me. I cannot breathe.” He grabbed me like that and kicked my face two times with his leg.\"",
